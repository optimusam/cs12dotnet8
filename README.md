## Code solutions for Visual Studio 2022 and Visual Studio Code

[Figures for all of the code solution folders](docs/ch01-solution-folders.md).

Visual Studio Code now has an extension named **C# Dev Kit** that includes a solution explorer so it can better work with Visual Studio 2022 solution files. Visual Studio 2022 for Windows, Visual Studio 2022 for Mac, and Visual Studio Code + C# Dev Kit can now use the same code solution files and projects for each chapter, found here: [/code](/code). 

> **For Visual Studio Code:** To use the chapter solution files with Visual Studio Code, install the **C# Dev Kit** extension. Then in Visual Studio Code, open the `ChapterNN` folder that contains a `ChapterNN.sln` solution file and wait for the **SOLUTION EXPLORER** pane to appear at the bottom of the **EXPLORER**. You can drag and drop to reorder the panes to put **SOLUTION EXPLORER** at the top. Learn more about C# Dev Kit at the following link: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/announcing-csharp-dev-kit-for-visual-studio-code/

> **Warning!** If you use both Visual Studio 2022 and Visual Studio Code to open these solutions, be aware that the build process can conflict. This is because Visual Studio 2022 has its own non-standard build server that is different from the standard build server used by .NET SDK CLI. My recommendation is to only have a solution open in one code editor at any time. You should also clean the solutions between opening in different code editors. For example, after closing the solution in one code editor, I delete the `bin` and `obj` folders before then opening in a different code editor.

## Companion Book

I have written a companion book titled, *[Apps and Services with .NET 8](https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net8)*, that is designed to follow on from where this book ends. You can also jump to related chapters in the second book to go deeper in topics of interest to go beyond the fundamentals, as shown in the following diagram:

## Microsoft Certifications

Announcing the New Foundational C# Certification with freeCodeCamp:
https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-foundational-csharp-certification/

Microsoft used to have professional exams and certifications for developers that covered skills like C# and ASP.NET. Sadly, they have retired them all. These days, the only developer-adjacent exams and certifications are for Azure or Power Platform, as you can see from the certification poster: https://aka.ms/traincertposter
