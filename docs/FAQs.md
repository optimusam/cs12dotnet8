# Where can I buy your books in my country?

I live in the UK and I have no experience with buying books in your country but you probably do. Where have you bought books before in your country? Most bookstores will order a book for you if they do not have it in stock. If they cannot, then please ask the publisher, Packt, where you can buy Packt books in your country: customercare@packt.com. 

# Can you give me a free copy of your book?

No. It is not "my" book to give away. Some readers think that because my name is on the front cover, that means they are "my" books. Inside the book cover you will see who owns the book: **Copyright &copy; 2024 Packt Publishing**. Authors with publishers just write the content. I am not involved in pricing and distribution, and I certainly cannot give them away for free. 

# How can I get a Packt book as a PDF?

You have two options to get a Packt book in PDF format:

1. If you purchase any other format of the book from anywhere else then you can get the PDF edition by completing a form on Packt's website with proof of purchase: https://www.packtpub.com/page/free-ebook. For example, you might buy the paperback from your local independent bookstore, or you might buy the Kindle edition from Amazon.

2. If you purchase an ebook from Packt's website then you get it in PDF and EPUB formats as well as their online reader.
