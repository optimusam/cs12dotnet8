# Errata and Improvements

If you find any mistakes in the eighth edition, *C# 12 and .NET 8 - Modern Cross-Platform Development Fundamentals*, or if you have suggestions for improvements, then please [raise an issue in this repository](https://github.com/markjprice/cs12dotnet8/issues) or email me at markjprice (at) gmail.com.

[**Errata** (42 items)](errata.md): Typos, tool user interface and behavior changes, or mistakes in code that would cause a compilation error that prevents a successful build.

[**Improvements** (59 items)](improvements.md): Changes to text or code that would improve the content. These are optional.

[**Common Mistakes** (6 items)](common-mistakes.md): These are some of the most common mistakes that a reader might encounter when trying to get code in book tasks to work, or when trying to write your own code. 

All errata and improvements will be included in the 9th edition planned for publishing in November 2024. To be included they must be submitted by mid-September 2024.
